# C Programming
A collection of C programs that I have coded during college classes or as a part of a college assignment such as Fibonacci Detection, String Reversal, Palindrome, Krishnamurthy Number & Many others.
C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.
